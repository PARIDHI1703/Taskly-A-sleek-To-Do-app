Taskly: A sleek To-Do app
Taskly is a clean, minimalist, and client-side to-do list application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to be an "external cortex"â€”a simple tool to offload your mental tasks, connect your thoughts to actions, and provide clarity on what needs to be done next.

âœ¨ Features
Add New Tasks: Quickly add tasks to your list via an input field.

Mark as Complete: Simply click on a task to toggle its completion status.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need with a dedicated delete button.

Data Persistence: Your tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so your list will be waiting for you even after you close the tab or refresh the page.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack
HTML5: Provides the core structure and semantic markup for the application.

CSS3: Used for all styling, layout, and making the interface clean and user-friendly.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): The "brain" of the application, handling all logic, user interaction, and data management without any external libraries or frameworks.

Browser Local Storage API: A web storage API used for persisting task data on the client-side.

ðŸ§  Core Technical Concepts
This project demonstrates a solid understanding of fundamental front-end web development concepts.

DOM Manipulation

The task list is not hard-coded in the HTML. Instead, JavaScript dynamically creates, modifies, and deletes HTML elements (<li> and <button>) in response to user input. This is achieved using methods like document.createElement(), appendChild(), and removeChild().

Event Handling & Event Delegation

The application is fully interactive thanks to JavaScript event listeners (addEventListener).

For efficiency, Event Delegation is used to manage clicks on the task list. A single event listener is attached to the parent <ul> element instead of attaching a separate listener to every single task. When a click occurs, the event's target property is inspected to determine if a task item or a delete button was clicked, making the app more performant.

Data Persistence with localStorage

To save tasks, the application uses the browser's localStorage. Since localStorage can only store string key-value pairs, the application's task data (an array of JavaScript objects) is first serialized into a JSON string using JSON.stringify().

When the page loads, this JSON string is retrieved from localStorage and deserialized back into a usable JavaScript array with JSON.parse(), allowing the application to rebuild the user's task list.

ðŸš€ How to Run Locally
This is a purely front-end project and requires no special build steps.

Clone the repository or download the files.

git clone <your-repo-url>


Navigate to the project directory.

cd <your-repo-folder>


Open the index.html file in your web browser.

You can do this by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with..." your browser of choice.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements
Edit Tasks: Implement functionality to edit the text of an existing task.

Task Filtering: Add buttons to filter between "All," "Active," and "Completed" tasks.

Due Dates & Priorities: Allow users to add optional due dates or priority levels to tasks.

Improved Accessibility: Enhance the application with ARIA attributes for better screen reader support.
